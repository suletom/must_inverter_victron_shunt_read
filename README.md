This it just a test script. The original idea was to make display a for an off grid solar system with Raspberry Pi-HAT.

I encountered varios communication problems on the inverter side that made impossible to query data reliable.

Setup: 
GreenCell 3000W 24V inverter (originates from "MUST" OEM and uses MODBUS protocol over USB serial connection)
Raspberry PI3 with PI-HAT Led matrix 
Victron Smart shunt with bluetooth enabled (connected through the default linux bluetooth stack)
